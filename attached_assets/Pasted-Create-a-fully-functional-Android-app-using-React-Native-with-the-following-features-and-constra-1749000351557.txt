Create a fully functional Android app using **React Native** with the following features and constraints:

🟢 App Name: **First Million**

🎯 Goal:
A personal finance tracker focused on the philosophy:
**"Increase income, decrease expenses, and invest the gap."**
The app helps users reach financial stability or wealth by managing income, controlling spending, and tracking investments over time.

🔐 Authentication:
- Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication

📐 UI & UX:
- Custom modern UI (use Tailwind-style or CSS-in-JS)
- Beautiful rounded cards, soft shadows, gradient progress bars
- Color-coded graphs, smooth animations, and bottom navigation
- Light/dark theme switcher (Pro users only)

🌐 Language: English only

🔌 Offline-First:
- Local storage via SQLite (or WatermelonDB)
- All operations are local by default
- Sync with **Supabase** when online (push/pull model)

🧱 Data Model (Supabase Schema):
- `users` (id, email, created_at)
- `categories` (id, type: "income"|"expense", name, icon, user_id)
- `transactions` (id, category_id, type: "income"|"expense", amount, date, description, user_id)
- `investments` (id, name, type: "crypto"|"stock"|"local", symbol, value_history[], is_manual: boolean, user_id)
- `goals` (id, category_id, limit_amount, alert_triggered, user_id)

⚙️ App Logic:

1. 🆕 **First Launch Behavior**:
   - App initializes with zero values for all graphs
   - No pre-filled categories or expenses
   - User adds custom categories (income or expense)

2. 🧩 **Category Manager**:
   - Add/Edit/Delete categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Freelance)
   - When a category is deleted, its associated transactions are also removed
   - Pie chart and other graphs dynamically update when categories change

3. 💸 **Expense & Income Tracker**:
   - User selects a category, adds amount and optional description
   - Pie chart visualizes expenses by category
   - Bar graph shows budget vs actual per category
   - Budget alerts: change color when user approaches/exceeds goal

4. 💼 **Income Tracker**:
   - Show total monthly income across categories
   - Allow multiple income sources (Business, Job, etc.)
   - Option to set income goals per category

5. 📈 **Investment Tracker**:
   - Add assets like Crypto (via CoinGecko), Stocks (via Alpha Vantage), or Local business (manual input)
   - Track value changes over time (manual for local, API for crypto/stocks)
   - Multi-line graph view with color-coded performance

6. 🎯 **Goal Tracker**:
   - Set monthly spending goals per category
   - Trigger notifications/alerts as user approaches limit

7. 📊 **Reports Page**:
   - Graphs for past 3/6/12 months
   - Download CSV report (optional)
   - Savings tracker: shows “income – expenses” trend

8. 🧱 **Architecture Notes**:
   - Only one user/account per device (no multi-wallet system)
   - Local SQLite mirrors Supabase schema
   - Sync logic handles merging offline edits with server
   - Export/import local backups (Pro feature)

9. 💎 **Pro Features (via Stripe or Google Play Billing)**:
   - Unlock themes
   - Enable export as CSV
   - Passcode/biometric lock
   - Home screen widget
   - Yearly trends graph

📦 Stack:
- React Native (bare or Expo)
- Firebase Authentication (Google login only)
- SQLite or WatermelonDB for offline storage
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for sync
- CoinGecko / Alpha Vantage for asset prices
- Stripe or Google Play Billing for subscriptions

🛠️ Deliverables:
- Modular React Native codebase with:
   - Auth screen
   - Dashboard with expense/income/investment overview
   - Category manager
   - Transaction page (add/edit/remove)
   - Budget and goal tracker
   - Investment screen (with charts)
   - Reports page
   - Sync logic for offline + Supabase
   - Pro feature toggle system

All graphs and analysis must reflect only user-created categories and dynamically adjust as categories or transactions are added/edited/removed.
