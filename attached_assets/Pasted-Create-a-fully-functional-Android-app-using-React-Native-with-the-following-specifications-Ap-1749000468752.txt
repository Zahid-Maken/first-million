Create a fully functional Android app using React Native with the following specifications:

📱 App Name: "Lovable – Your First Million"

🎯 Purpose:
A financial behavior-changing app designed to help users become financially stable or rich through one guiding principle: “Increase income, decrease expenses, and invest the gap.”

💡 Key Philosophy:
This is more than just an expense tracker — it is a life financial coach built around habit transformation, analytics, and goal tracking.

🔐 Auth:
- Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication

🌐 Language: English only

🎨 UI:
- React Native with a modern, minimal, custom theme (rounded cards, smooth shadows, bright and soft color palette)
- Tailwind-style styling (or similar utility-based CSS-in-JS)
- Animated graphs and interactive components
- Multiple tabs with bottom navigation

🧱 App Architecture:
- Offline-first using SQLite (e.g., with React Native SQLite or WatermelonDB)
- Background Supabase sync (triggered when online)
- Data models handled via Supabase schema + local SQLite mapping
- Store data in local DB first, sync with Supabase in background

🔄 Supabase Schema:
- users (id, email, auth_provider, created_at)
- categories (id, type: "income"|"expense", name, icon, user_id)
- transactions (id, type: "income"|"expense", category_id, amount, date, note, user_id)
- investments (id, type: "crypto"|"stock"|"local", name, user_input?:boolean, symbol?, value_history[], user_id)
- goals (id, category_id, limit_amount, alert_triggered, user_id)
- wallets (id, name, balance, type: "cash"|"bank"|"crypto", user_id)
